## Objective
Review concepts related to the construction of integrated species distribution models using R-INLA. By the end of this module, you should have a better understanding of 1) how to combine multiple data sources to estimate a species distribution and 2) how to generally build complex regression models in R using the INLA package

Disclaimer: This is a product that I put together as I teach myself these concepts. It is my attempt to consolidate my readings in my own words. There are citations throughout and at the end of the document which you can follow up on. If you find an error, notice important concepts missing, or just generally see room for improvement, please feel free to let me know.

##iSDM Overview
Hopefully if you are reading this you are familiar with species distribution models, but if not here are some general readings that discuss [basic concepts related to SDMs](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.110308.120159) and [their application](https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.12268). In brief, these are models which estimate the relative distribution of individuals across an area, usually based on metrics associated with occurrence or abundance. These models can be built from presence-abscence, point count, or presence-only data types. However, all surveys will have some limitations related to methodology or sampling in space and time which can bias observations. As an extension of SDMs, integrated approaches have been developed to try and mitigate some of these survey specific limitations. By combining multiple datasets into a single modeling framework, you can use the strengths of each survey to compensate for the weaknesses of the other datasets. For example, you may conduct structured point count surveys to identify the distribution of a bird species. These surveys allow for the incorporation of detection covariates which improve estimates, but they are also costly and time intensive which limits sampling to a small area or leads to sparse sampling a larger area. Alternatively, we could use publicly available citizen science data such as EBird, which samples space and time much more thoroughly but is opportunistically sampled which leads to greater uncertainty and hinders estimation of detection. By combining the two datasets, we have a model that adequately samples space and time AND accommodates variation related to detection.

Despite being relatively new, the development of integrated SDM approaches has shown considerable expansion recently. As there are a wide variety of ways to construct an SDM, there are a diversity of potential ways that they could be incorporated, and so a number of these types of models have been published. Despite being often very different, these models generally follow a similar modeling framework made up of a process model which describes the true relative distribution of individuals in space, and multiple observation models which describe how this distribution translates to individual survey observations. For example, point count data differs from telemetry data, but these observation originate from the same underlying species distribution.

![iSDM basic overview figure](file)

Often we do not care much about the individual observation models beyond controlling for bias. Rather, we focus on the process model describing the underlying distribution of animals, usually by relating observations with local covariates identified by the researcher. However, it is unlikely that you will be able to identify all of the drivers of animal movement and occurence within a system, which means that there will be some residual amount of spatial and temporal autocorrelation which could bias estimates. Imagine a scenario where you are surveying an area but are unaware of several bait stations which influence animal movements. These local drivers will potentially bias estimates if they are not accounted for. As such, a lot of work how gone into developing methods to account for such autocorrelation. These approaches can be grouped into two broad types, state-space and point process models.

In a state-space approach, the landscape is discretized into some grid of cells (square or hexagon for example), and surveys are grouped according to which cell they are in. You then estimate correlation among grid cells to account for spatial autocorrelation of observations. This approach can be beneficial when working in an MCMC framework, as continuous methods for dealing with spatial autocorrelation are significantly more computationally expensive. However, this approach will be responsive to the size of the grid cells, which requires some careful consideration. While prevelant in the literature, we will not worry about these types of models.
[State Space Figure]

Instead, we will focus on point process iSDMS, which treat the process model as a continuous surface and employ dimension reduction approaches to estimate spatial autocorrelation. Dimension reduction refers to methods which project the underlying process model onto a mesh of points. Spatial autocorrelation is estimated among all points within this mesh, and then individual observations are associated with only the nearest mesh locations to account for autocorrelation in observed data. While there are ways to apply these ideas in MCMC ([Not an SDM, but here is an example of dimension reduction in JAGS](https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.9444)). However, INLA has a very useful capacity for dealing with spatial autocorrelation via [SPDE](https://becarioprecario.bitbucket.io/spde-gitbook/), which follows this same general mesh building process. INLA is limited to models that can be expressed as latent Gaussian Markov random fields](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sste.2013.07.003), which means it is more restricted in the types of model one can run compared to MCMC, but the computational advantages greatly compensate for such limitations.

##Case Study - Waterfowl Distributions for modeling HPAI risk
Before we jump into coding, I want to backup and provide some background as to why we explored these models in the first place. This project began as a larger effort to model the risk of avian influenza across broad landscapes. These models are based on the overlap between the distribution of spillover risk associated with both specific poultry farming operations and the distribution of susceptible waterfowl species on the landscape. Where these overlap with the greatest intensities indicate where risk is highest. Because avian influenza is a global problem which affects many species and industries, we set out to build a flexible framework which could be applied to any number of regions, scales, and species combinations. 

Initial modeling of HPAI risk was done using EBird status and trends data, but there were multiple reasons to believe that this is an imperfect characterization of waterfowl distributions. These surveys are opportunistic and are rarely conducted with waterfowl in mind, leaving some question as to the usefulness of this data. Instead of throwing it away or living with the potential bias, we can instead incorporate other surveys to account for the weaknesses. For example, we could incorporate annual structured surveys into our model such as the breeding bird survey or christmas bird count. These surveys may be more sparsely distributed in space and time, but they more evenly cover the area of interest, and repeated counts at the same location allow for the estimation of detection. We can also include bird banding lab information, another opportunistically sampled dataset, which is much more biased in its sampling but would directly target waterfowl. We will walk through how these different data types, their positives and negatives, and how they are incorporated into our model.

##The Data
Before we start talking about coding, here is a breakdown of all of the major data sets we used, both the surveys for waterfowl as well as environmental covariates. All datasets are publically available for the entire United States.

### The Surveys
**North American Breeding Bird Survey** - Structured point count surveys, early June. A survey consists of 50 stops along a given transect. Final count is the summed count at all stops for a transect. [BBS Project Website, including data access.](https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/)

**Audobon Christmas Bird Count** - Structured point count surveys, late December. [CBC Project Website, including data access.](https://www.audubon.org/conservation/science/christmas-bird-count)

**EBird** - Citizen science initiative where birders report their sightings with dates and locations. There are limitations as you go back in time, and you are limited by presence of humans. [EBird Project Website, including data access.](https://ebird.org/home)

**Bird Banding Laboratory** - Opportunistic observations covering majority of year, but mostly in fall. Represent targeted captures of individuals, thus not randomly sampled.[BBL Project Website, including data access.](https://www.usgs.gov/labs/bird-banding-laboratory)

### The Environmental Covariates
**National Wetland Iventory** - Provides information on wetland locations within the United States[NWI Project Website, including data access.](https://www.fws.gov/program/national-wetlands-inventory/data-download)

**National Hydrography Dataset** - Provides information on surface water locations within the United States, which we further broke into classifications of flowing (river/stream) and standing (pond/lake) water. [NHD Project Website, including data access.](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/national-hydrography-dataset)

**National Land Cover Database** - Provided information on developed and agricultural land [NLCD Project Website, including data access.](https://www.mrlc.gov/)

## Getting Started
OK, now lets start working in some code. To run these models, we are going to use INLA, which stands for "integrated nested Laplace approximation." This Bayesian model approach was suggested by [Rue et al. 2009](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9868.2008.00700.x) as a means to approximate an MCMC model with much greater computational efficiency. These types of models are limited to latent Gaussian models, which includes many common statistical approaches used in ecology. For further information on INLA specifically, start with this review paper, [Rue et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-statistics-060116-054045)

INLA is not available on CRAN so must be downloaded directly. [INLA Install Website](https://www.r-inla.org/download-install). As INLA is a new product, it is regularly updated, so make sure you are using the most up to date version to improve model run times.
```{r, eval=F}
install.packages("INLA",repos=c(getOption("repos"),INLA="https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/stable"), dep=TRUE)
inla.upgrade()
```

Once INLA is ready to go, we can setup the rest of our environment by loading all the relevant data. I am going to bring in a shapefile which defines our area of interest (in this model that is the Chesapeake Bay and surrounding area), as well as our 4 survey data sets. We will focus on observations of the American Black Duck (ABDU).

We bring in each data set from a CSV, which includes date, XY location, and count information from all surveys. Some data sets include additional survey-type specific information, such as the distance covered, which could be incorporated to account for detection. 

Coding Note: You will see that I am subsetting our eBird Data, this is purely to improve run time in the construction of this document.
```{r, eval = F}
#Clear Environment
rm(list = ls())

#Study Area
studyarea <- st_read("StudyArea.shp") %>%
  st_transform(4326) #Make sure everything uses the same coordiante system

#Survey Data. Will limit to ABDU for example code
ebird.data <- read.csv("EBird_Counts.csv") %>% filter(AOU == "ABDU") %>%
    slice(sample(1:nrow(.), 5000)) #There are so many surveys, will subset for run time
bbs.data <- read.csv("BBS_Counts.csv") %>% filter(AOU == "ABDU")
cbc.data <- read.csv("CBC_Counts.csv") %>% filter(AOU == "ABDU")
bbl.data <- read.csv("BBL_Counts.csv") %>% filter(AOU == "ABDU")
```

I will also bring in our environmental covariates, which need to be linked with the survey information. We can also organize any detection covariates if we were to be using any.

```{r, eval = F}
#Environmental covariates at point locations
isdm.sf <- st_read("SurveyLocationsAll.shp") %>%
  mutate(X = st_coordinates(.)[,1], Y = st_coordinates(.)[,2]) %>% #Add XY coordinates as 2 columns
  st_drop_geometry() %>% #converts to df
  relocate(X, Y) %>% #move XY columns to first positions in df
  mutate_all(~ ifelse(. == -9999, 0, .)) %>% select(-FID_1) %>% #ArcGIS method leaves zero values NA, need to adjust
  rename(D2Wetland = D2Wetlan_1, D2SurfWat = D2SurfWa_1) %>% #Rename columns to match throughout
  select(-contains(c("0_3", "_2_5", "_5"))) #Drop scales we aren't interested in

  #Merge spatial covariates and count dataframes
  ebird.xy <- ebird.data %>% select(RowID, X, Y)
  bbs.xy <- bbs.data %>% select(RowID, X, Y)
  cbc.xy <- cbc.data %>% select(RowID, X, Y)
  bbl.xy <- bbl.data %>% select(RowID, X, Y)
  ebird.env <- merge(ebird.xy, isdm.sf, by = c("X", "Y"), all.x = T) %>%
    arrange(RowID)
  bbs.env <- merge(bbs.xy, isdm.sf, by = c("X", "Y"), all.x = T) %>%
    arrange(RowID)
  cbc.env <- merge(cbc.xy, isdm.sf, by = c("X", "Y"), all.x = T) %>%
    arrange(RowID)
  bbl.env <- merge(bbl.xy, isdm.sf, by = c("X", "Y"), all.x = T) %>%
    arrange(RowID)
  
#Extract detection covariates into their own dataframe
  ebird.det <- ebird.data %>% select(RowID, Minutes, DistKM, NObs) %>%
    arrange(RowID)
  bbs.det <- bbs.data %>% select(RowID) %>%
    mutate(DistKM =  39.42893) %>%
    arrange(RowID)
  cbc.det <- cbc.data %>% select(RowID, DistKM = TDist, NSO.CBC = NSppObs) %>%
    arrange(RowID)
  bbl.det <- bbl.data %>% select(RowID, NCap) %>%
    mutate(DistKM =  .001) %>%
    arrange(RowID)  
```

## Temporal Autocorrelation
One aspect of our model we haven't directly addressed yet is time trends. As we are interested in how HPAI risk changes throughout the year, the iSDM must be able to describe the temporal variation in waterfowl distributions. We will broadly account for seasonal differences (Wintering vs Migration vs Breeding) using the SPDE approach described next, but we may also expect fine scale temporal trends in occurrence and abundance, related to the more regional/local movements of individuals. A "simple" way toa ccount for such finer scale correlations in time series data is by incorporating an autoregressive term into your model (AR1 model). Ignoring the math, this allows time step **t** to be directly influenced by timestep **t-1**. This is one of many ways in which we can deal with time. For further reading, see [Auger-Methe et al. 2021 - A guide to stateâ€“space modeling of ecological time series](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecm.1470).

The code below takes the date of all survey, and classifies each according to 2-week blocks, month, and season as defined by month. 

```{r, eval = F}
  #Define temporal periods using dates and homebrew function below
  temp.periods <- function(df){df %>% select(RowID, Date) %>%
      mutate(Date = as.Date(Date)) %>% #convert to date formate
      mutate(Week2 = ceiling(yday(Date)/14), Month = month(Date)) %>% #Create necessary time blocks
      mutate(Season = with(., case_when((Month <= 3) ~ 1, #Seasons are based on the month of observation
                                        (Month >= 4 & Month <= 6) ~ 2, #1 = winter, 2 = winter to breeding migration
                                        (Month >= 7 & Month <= 9) ~ 3, # 3 = breeding grounds, 4 = breeding to winter migration
                                        (Month >= 10 & Month <= 12) ~ 4,
                                        is.na(Month)~NA, TRUE~NA)))}
  
  ebird.temp <- temp.periods(ebird.data) %>%
    arrange(RowID)
  bbs.temp <- temp.periods(bbs.data) %>%
    arrange(RowID)
  cbc.temp <- temp.periods(cbc.data) %>%
    arrange(RowID)
  bbl.temp <- temp.periods(bbl.data) %>%
    arrange(RowID)
```

## Accounting for spatial or spatiotemporal autocorrelation via SPDE in INLA
Now that the other aspects of our data are prepared, we can begin to setup our SPDE, which we will use to account for spatial autocorrelation. As I alluded to in the previous section, we will be employing a spatiotemporal SPDE approach to account for seasonal differences in distributions. What this means practically is that we will create a unique SPDE spatial field describing spatial autocorrelation for each season. From an ecological standpoint this makes sense, as we would not necessarily expect the same areas to be used by waterfowl during migration as during the wintering or breeding periods. 

The process of setting up an SPDE can be broken down into 1) constructing a mesh of locations which encompasses your study area, 2) associating all locations of survey observations with the nearest mesh locations, 3) establish any temporal dynamics in your SPDE (for spatiotemporal autocorrelation models), and 4) construct your INLA stack objects and run the model.

The mesh is made up of two sections, an internal mesh which has a greater density of points for making inference, and a secondary boundary mesh, which is much less detailed and is included to limit the bias at the edges of our area of interest. Mesh construction requires setting a number of parameters within functions, so lets break them all down. You will initially create a mesh using the **inla.mesh.2d** function, which has parameters **boundary** (sets the boundary of our mesh), **cutoff** (optional, refers to the shortest allowed distance between two mesh vertices), and **max.edge** (radius around observations at which autocorrelation falls below .1). You need to be thoughtful about how you setup your mesh, as its been shown that how you build it can impact model inference.[Dambly et al. 2023 (Integrated species distribution models fitted in INLA are sensitive to mesh parameterisation)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.06391) demonstrated this, and also provides some guidance on how to build your mesh. Findings showed that increasing coarseness affected accuracy, but there is a serious risk of overfitting with finer mesh. This did impact estimates. [Example Code](https://github.com/LeaDambly/IM_serotine/tree/main/02_code)
* Max.edge.1 should be about the range of your species of interest. Also stated that it should be set smaller than 1/5 of the "range", which is the radius around observations at which autocorrelation falls below .1
* Max.edge.2 must be greater than max.edge.1
* Cutoff should be approximately 1/5 of max.edge.1
```{r, eval = F}
studyarea.sp <- spTransform(as(studyarea, "Spatial"), CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84")) #package requires sp object
max.edge.1 <- .1 #.1 decimal degree == 11.1 km,
max.edge.2 <- 2
mesh <- inla.mesh.2d(boundary = inla.sp2segment(studyarea.sp),
                     cutoff = max.edge.1/5,
                     max.edge = c(max.edge.1, max.edge.2))
plot(mesh)
```
![Example of SPDE Mesh](Mesh.jpeg)

You will then create an SPDE model object using the **inla.spde2.pcmatern** function, which asks for a **prior.range** and **prior.sigma**. These are penalized complexity (PC) priors for the components of the SPDE model spatial field which define the distance of the effect (range) and the magnitude of the variance (sigma). PC priors work by setting some value and probability which define the likihood that an estimate would exceed some limit. So for range, we provide prior.range = c(range0, Prange), such that the resulting prior satisfies P(range < range0) = Prange. For variance, we specify prior.sigma = c(sigma0, Psigma), such that the resulting prior satisfies P(sigma > sigma_0) = Psigma

Here are a couple of additional links regarding the selection of priors, however I will note that  Dambly et al. did not find that prior specifications greatly influenced inference, so don't agonize too much on these values compared to mesh construction. [R-INLA Google Group discussion on choice of priors for spde mesh](https://groups.google.com/g/r-inla-discussion-group/c/dunoXK_yAco), [R-INLA page on Priors for SPDE](https://becarioprecario.bitbucket.io/inla-gitbook/ch-spatial.html#castilla-la-mancha-forest-fires).
# For range, it is advisable not to favour ranges that are smaller than the resolution of the mesh
# For variance, priors are chosen to shrink towards small values of the standard deviation for the spatial field. The user must select which standard deviations for the spatial field that are so high that they are unfeasible for the problem at hand.



```{r, eval = F}
spde.z <- inla.spde2.pcmatern(mesh = mesh, constr = T,
                              prior.range = c(max.edge.1*3, 0.1),
                              prior.sigma = c(.5, 0.01))
spde.y <- inla.spde2.pcmatern(mesh = mesh, constr = T,
                              prior.range = c(max.edge.1*3, 0.1),
                              prior.sigma = c(1, 0.01))

```

Next we will create a temporal mesh, which has nodes for each season. We use the **inla.spde.make.index** to identify the structure of the SPDE and name the field for use within INLA. Finally, we create an **A matrix**, which tells INLA how our data is organized in relationship to our meshes.

```{r, eval = F}
#Create 1d temporal mesh for month, to = # of weeks in analysis
mesh.t <- inla.mesh.1d(seq(from = 1, to = 4, by = 1))
k <- mesh.t$n
  
#links temporal and spatial
zset.ebird <- zset.bbs <- zset.cbc <- zset.bbl <- inla.spde.make.index('z1',
                                                                       n.spde = spde.z$n.spde,
                                                                       n.group = k)
yset.ebird <- yset.bbs <- yset.cbc <- yset.bbl <- inla.spde.make.index('y1',
                                                                       n.spde = spde.y$n.spde,
                                                                       n.group = k)
  
#Create A Matrix

###BBL data requires a slightly different adjustment discussed next
```

## Accounting for sampling bias in Presence-Only Data
In some cases, we may have information on the location of individuals, but the data was collected in an uneven or targeted manner which violates assumptions of random sampling. So in this example, BBL data provides us useful information on where waterfowl species were, but only because these captures were targeting them. Thus while the locations do reflect real waterfowl presence, its collection was heavily biased by trapping efforts and project objectives. To allow for Presence-Only information to be included in the model, we need a way to account for the uneven sampling across the landscape. We can do this by including a secondary SPDE spatial field that specifically is derived from the distribution of the presence-only data. For a detailed discussion, see [Simpson et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/asv064). This paper discusses the general methods for deriving the mesh for this SPDE component, referred to here as integration points for the PO data. As previously mentioned, the more complex these SPDE meshes are, the longer your model run time will be. We can simplify the mesh by treating unsampled areas as smoother parts of the field, which practically translates to fewer mesh vertices where there are larger spaces of unsampled area. I set my PO mesh according to code outlined in [Ahmad Suhaimi et al. 2021](https://github.com/NERC-CEH/IDM_comparisons/blob/master/Run%20models%20joint.R).

Initial integration points are taken directly from the SPDE mesh previously constructed

[Do we need a sampling bias field for both occurrence and abundance? I don't think so]
[Do we need to duplicate integration points for the different seasons? I don't think so]

## Specifying a model formula
Now that all of our data is ready, we can write out our model formula. Lets break down all the aspects of our models. First, we have our intercepts, which will be specific to each observation model. We will then specify any covariates we wish to include. Anything describing the difference in an underlying process model, will be specific to that model. Thus, occurrence and abundance models would not share covariates, but surveys would. The rest of the model components are more complex, requiring specific calls within the INLA f() function. The first here is our AR1 model describing monthly temporal autocorrelation. Within this f() call, we specify the column which denotes our temporal period (could use Week2 for finer scale inference), the type of model ('ar1'), and define any hyperparameters. Here we specify our priors according to recommendations from [CITATION](CITATION)

You will see the model specification within the SPDE f() call to be **iid**, which stands for "independent and identically distributed". This otherwise says that we expect the seasonal SPDEs to be independent from one another our model. You can specify this as other model types, such as an ar1 model if you assumed that the distributions were heavily influenced by the previous distribution of birds. As we already have the finer scale temporal component, this is unncessary here.

  Env.Cov + Det.Cov + Temp.Cov + #relevant fixed effect covariates are included

## Extract Results from the final model object
All the individual model estimates can be extracted from the final model object by working through the object structure.We just need to know how to navigate the object structure to get to it. We can start with the fixed effects, which are stored under "summary.fixed". 
```{r, echo = F, results = 'hide'}
load("./example.R")

#Study Area
studyarea <- st_read("StudyArea.shp") %>%
  st_transform(4326) #Make sure everything uses the same coordiante system
studyarea.sp <- spTransform(as(studyarea, "Spatial"), CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84")) #package requires sp object
max.edge.1 <- .1 #.1 decimal degree == 11.1 km,
max.edge.2 <- 2
mesh <- inla.mesh.2d(boundary = inla.sp2segment(studyarea.sp),
                     cutoff = max.edge.1/5,
                     max.edge = c(max.edge.1, max.edge.2))
mesh.coords <- st_as_sf(data.frame(X = mesh$loc[,1], Y = mesh$loc[,2]), coords = c("X", "Y"), crs = 4326)
zset.ebird <- inla.spde.make.index('z1',
                                  n.spde = nrow(mesh.coords),
                                  n.group = 4)
```
```{r}
# Intercept and Fixed Effect Coefficient Estimates
final.model$summary.fixed

final.model$summary.fixed %>%
  mutate(ID = row.names(.)) %>%
  select(ID, Estimate = mean, sd, LCL = `0.025quant`, UCL = `0.975quant`) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = ID)) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 0), linetype = "dashed", alpha = .7) +
  geom_point(aes(x = Estimate)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(xmin = LCL, xmax = UCL), width = .35) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(title = paste0("ABDU", " - Coefficient Estimates")) +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank())
```

Next, lets pull out the AR1 model estimates to show us how the model is generally changing over time. These will be named components under "summary.random" 
```{r}
#AR1 Model estimates for fine-scale temporal autocorrelation
#will be nested within "summary.random", using a name you set
final.model$summary.random$Month.Z

final.model$summary.random$Month.Z %>%
  select(Month = ID, Estimate = mean, LCL = '0.025quant', UCL = '0.975quant') %>%
  mutate(Intercept = final.model$summary.fixed["int.ebird.Z", "mean"]) %>%
  mutate(RelOcc = exp(Intercept + Estimate)/(1+exp(Intercept + Estimate)),
         OccLCL = exp(Intercept + LCL)/(1+exp(Intercept + LCL)),
         OccUCL = exp(Intercept + UCL)/(1+exp(Intercept + UCL))) %>%
  filter(Month < 13) %>%
  mutate(Month = as.factor(Month)) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x = Month)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = RelOcc), size = 3) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = OccLCL, ymax = OccUCL), width = .35) +
  theme_classic(base_size = 20) + 
  labs(y = "Estimate") +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank())
```

To explore the spatial/spatio-temporal dynamics of the model, we can extract the SPDE model estimates, and project them onto a grid of points for visualizing. These will similarly be stored under "summary.random" and are named whatever you specified in the model structure.Note: you can also use this code below to extract the sampling bias field for your PO surveys.
```{r}
sf_use_s2(FALSE) #Change option in SF to prevent errors 
stepsize <- 2 * 1 / 111 #Distance between prediction points
#Define the area to be predicted for
min_x <- min(st_coordinates(mesh.coords)[,1])
max_x <- max(st_coordinates(mesh.coords)[,1])
min_y <- min(st_coordinates(mesh.coords)[,2])
max_y <- max(st_coordinates(mesh.coords)[,2])
#Number of rows and columns
nxy <- round(c(max_x-min_x, max_y-min_y) / stepsize)
#Project these points onto the SPDE mesh
projgrid <- inla.mesh.projector(mesh, 
                                xlim = c(min_x, max_x), 
                                ylim = c(min_y, max_y), 
                                dims = nxy)
#Find which spots on grid fall out of study area
xy.in <- inout(projgrid$lattice$loc,
               st_coordinates(studyarea)[,1:2])

#Extract the estimates for the spatial field at each prediction point.
st_z_mean <- df.z <- plot.z <- list()
#look through temporal blocks
for (j in 1:4){
  st_z_mean[[j]] <- inla.mesh.project(projgrid, #Grid 
    final.model$summary.random$z1$mean[zset.ebird$z1.group == j]) #Values
}

#Can use the grid to see our sampling bias field as well
# sb_mean <- inla.mesh.project(projgrid, 
#                              final.model$summary.random$unstr_field$mean)
```

And you can plot this however you like, but I have a preference for staying within the tidyverse and ggplot2 realm. So below is some example code on how one could plot these spatiotemporal dynamics across your study area. It requires that you have built in prediction points.
```{r, eval = F}
#Example Plotting Method
for (j in 1:4) {
  #Drop values not in study area
  st_z_mean[[j]][!xy.in] <- NA
  #Create simple dataframe with X, Y, and value
  df.z[[j]] <- data.frame(x = rep(projgrid$x,length(projgrid$y)),
                          y = rep(projgrid$y, each = length(projgrid$x)),
                          z = as.vector(st_z_mean[[j]]))
  #Plot in ggplot2
  plot.z[[j]] <- ggplot() +
    geom_raster(data = df.z[[j]], 
                aes(x = x, 
                    y = y, 
                    fill = z), 
                na.rm = T) +
    #overlay coast, looks nice
    geom_sf(data = coast) +
    #Set limits of map
    coord_sf(xlim = st_bbox(studyarea)[c(1,3)],
             ylim = st_bbox(studyarea)[c(2,4)]) +
    #Set break values, looks nice
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(-78,-77,-76,-75)) +
    #Change colot of na.values
    scale_fill_viridis(na.value = "white") +
    theme_classic(base_size = 24) +
    #Labels
    labs(x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude",
         fill = "Z Field",
         title = case_when((j == 1)~"Winter",
                           (j == 2)~"Spring",
                           (j == 3)~"Summer",
                           (j == 4)~"Fall")) +
    #Plot specifics
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
          plot.margin = unit(c(1,1,1,1), "cm"),
          legend.key.height = unit(3, 'cm'))
}

#Patchwork pacakage method for gridding plots
fields.plot.z <- plot.z[[1]] + plot.z[[2]] +
  plot.z[[3]] +  plot.z[[4]] + 
  plot_layout(ncol = 2) + 
  plot_annotation(title = paste0(spp, ' - SPDE Spatial Field - Occurrence'),
                  theme = theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 34, 
                                                          hjust = .5)))
